Hereâ€™s a **detailed, actionable plan for the Experience Planner Agent**, similar in depth to the Accommodation Agent:

---

# ðŸŽ¡ **Experience Planner Agent â€” Detailed Plan**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Given:

* Location, dates, interests, available time, preferred standard.
  Return:
* Suggested itinerary with ranked activities (attractions, dining, entertainment) and estimated costs.

---

## ðŸªœ **Step-by-Step Approach**

### âœ… **1. Collect User Inputs**

From the chatbot conversation, gather:

* **Location** (city, region)
* **Trip dates and available days**
* **Group preferences / interests**:
  (e.g., culture, history, adventure, food, nightlife, nature, shopping, family-friendly, luxury)
* **Preferred standard**:
  (e.g., budget-friendly, standard, premium)
* **Time per day available for activities**

Store these inputs in a structured format.

---

### âœ… **2. Define Criteria**

Translate user inputs into search criteria:

* Categories of activities matching interests.
* Price range or standard (budget â†’ public/free options, premium â†’ exclusive tours).
* Distance and travel time from accommodation or city center.
* Opening hours aligned with trip dates.

Define **activity priority ranking factors:**

| Factor Weight (%)        |    |
| ------------------------ | -- |
| User interest match      | 40 |
| Reviews & ratings        | 30 |
| Cost fit (within budget) | 20 |
| Proximity                | 10 |

---

### âœ… **3. Search for Activities**

#### Data sources:

* Use APIs for travel and local experiences:

  * **Google Places API**
  * **TripAdvisor API** (if available)
  * **Viator API** (for tours & tickets)
  * Yelp / Foursquare for dining and entertainment
  * Local tourism boards / open datasets

#### Query:

Construct API queries for:

* Categories: museums, hiking, nightlife, etc.
* Open on the given dates & times.
* Within location radius.
* Filter by ratings, price level, and type.

Example query structure:

```
{
  "location": "Kyoto",
  "dates": ["2025-09-10", "2025-09-12"],
  "interests": ["culture", "food"],
  "standard": "standard"
}

```

---

### âœ… **4. Process & Rank Results**

* Parse API responses: extract name, type, rating, reviews count, price level, opening hours, coordinates.
* Filter by:

  * Open during planned days
  * Fits budget & standard
  * Matches at least one interest
* Rank by weighted factors (see table above).
* Group activities into a day-wise itinerary:

  * Account for travel time between activities.
  * Recommend 2â€“4 activities per day depending on intensity.

---

### âœ… **5. Output**

Return a **structured itinerary**:

| Day Time Activity Name Category Cost Link / Notes |           |                   |          |      |                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- | -------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| Day 1                                             | Morning   | Temple Visit      | Culture  | \$10 | link\_to\_booking |
| Day 1                                             | Afternoon | Sushi Class       | Food     | \$50 | link\_to\_booking |
| Day 1                                             | Evening   | Night Market Walk | Shopping | Free | local directions  |

Include estimated daily and total costs.

## ðŸ”§ **Tools & Tech**

âœ… Programming:

* Python or Node.js
  âœ… External APIs:
* Google Places API
* Yelp/Foursquare
* TripAdvisor (if API access)
  âœ… Optional:
* Use mapping libraries (like Google Maps) to estimate travel times.

---

## ðŸŒ± **Future Enhancements**

* Allow users to swap or remove activities dynamically.
* Suggest alternate activities if weather or time changes.
* Include ticket booking and reservation integration.
* Learn user preferences over time (recommend similar experiences in future trips).

If youâ€™d like, I can also write this into the existing project document or even draft pseudocode / API call templates for you. Shall I? ðŸš€
