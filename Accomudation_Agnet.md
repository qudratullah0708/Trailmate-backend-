Let‚Äôs break down **how the Accommodation Agent can actually find suitable housing** ‚Äî step by step.

Here‚Äôs a practical implementation strategy:

---

## üß≠ **Accommodation Agent: How to Build It**

### üéØ **Objective**

Given:

* Location, dates, group size, budget, preferred standard.
  Return:
* Ranked list of housing options with price, ratings, booking info.

---

## ü™ú **Step-by-step Approach**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Collect User Inputs**

‚úÖ Gather inputs through the chatbot:

* Destination (city, area, or landmark)
* Check-in & check-out dates
* Number of guests
* Budget range
* Preferred standard (economy, standard, luxury)

Store these in a structured query.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Define Criteria**

From the inputs, define:

* Price range (calculated from budget & standard)
* Required room types (based on group size)
* Preferred distance from city center or specific landmarks

You can map standards like:

| Standard | Multiplier on average price |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Economy  | 0.8                         |
| Standard | 1.0                         |
| Luxury   | 1.5                         |

This helps adjust the budget range.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Search for Listings**

#### Data sources:

* Use APIs of booking platforms:

  * **Booking.com API**
  * **Airbnb API**
  * **Expedia API**
  * Local hotel directories (if no API, scrape web or maintain your own DB)

#### Query:

Construct an API query that includes:

* Location & dates
* Guests
* Price range
* Room type
* Filters: ratings, amenities, etc.

Example:

```json
{
  "location": "Paris",
  "check_in": "2025-08-01",
  "check_out": "2025-08-05",
  "guests": 4,
  "min_price": 100,
  "max_price": 300,
  "standard": "standard"
}
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Process Results**

‚úÖ Parse API responses:

* Extract: name, price per night, total cost, rating, amenities, distance, URL
  ‚úÖ Filter results to stay within budget & match preferences.
  ‚úÖ Rank results by:
* Best value (price/quality ratio)
* Highest ratings within budget
* Proximity to key points

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Output**

Format as a clear list or table:

| Rank | Hotel Name  | Price/Stay | Rating | Link                |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 1    | Hotel A     | \$250      | 8.7    | booking\_link\_here |
| 2    | Apartment B | \$220      | 8.5    | airbnb\_link\_here  |

---

## üîß **Tools & Tech**

‚úÖ Programming:

* Python (with `requests` / `httpx` for API calls)
* Or Node.js if preferred

‚úÖ External APIs:

* Booking.com API ([partner program](https://www.booking.com/affiliate-program/v2/index.html))
* Airbnb API (unofficial or via affiliate programs)
* Google Places API for additional hotel data
* HotelsCombined API

‚úÖ Optional:

* If no reliable API, scrape housing websites with `BeautifulSoup` / `Selenium`.

---

## üå± **Future Enhancements**

* Cache popular locations to reduce API calls.
* Use ML models to predict ‚Äúbest value‚Äù based on historical reviews.
* Allow users to save & compare options.
